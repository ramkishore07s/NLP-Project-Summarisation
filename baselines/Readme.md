## Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes

### <a href='https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B0Obe9L1qtsnSXZEd0JCenIyejg&export=download'>Dataset</a>:
* We use the <a href='https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B0Obe9L1qtsnSXZEd0JCenIyejg&export=download'>Dataset</a> given by <a href='https://aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1046'>Cheng et. al. 2016</a> which include several additions.

### **Modifications to the original data by <a href='https://aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1046'>Cheng et. al. 2016</a>.**
* NERed Data. All the named entities are replaced with unique tags.
* Truth labels for sentences to be extracted are generated using paralled corpora.

### Preprocessing
* Download the <a href='https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B0Obe9L1qtsnSXZEd0JCenIyejg&export=download'>zip file</a> and put it in the root folder of the project.
* run `./run.sh`.
* run the `Feature Extraction.ipynb` notebook in folder `baselines/`

### Helper functions
Run these two lines in IPython notebook to get all the features:
* `% run '<path to 'Get Features.ipynb>'`
* `pronoun, verbs, entity_counts, sen_len, sen_pos, stop_counts, output = get_all()
`

**NOTE: For baseline models we use truth labels generated by <a href='https://aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1046'>Cheng et. al. 2016</a>**
